       rest, and is the exit of the rest,
   You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of
       the soul.
   â€”Walt Whitman</pre></blockquote><p>This book aims to be neither the first word on the tangled problems of human society to-day, nor the last. My aim has been to emphasize, by the use of concrete and challenging examples and neglected facts, the need of a new approach to individual and social problems. Its central challenge is that civilization, in any true sense of the word, is based upon the control and guidance of the great natural instinct of Sex. Mastery of this force is possible only through the instrument of Birth Control.</p></div> </div>
